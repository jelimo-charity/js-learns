/*
Polymorphism is a word derived from the Greek language meaning "multiple forms".
 An alternative translation might be: "something that can take on many shapes".


So, to understand what polymorphism is about, let's consider some real-life 
objects.

    >>A door has a bell. It could be said that the bell is a property of the door 
object. This bell can be rung. When would someone ring a bell on the door? 
Obviously, to get someone to show up at the door.

    >>Now consider a bell on a bicycle. A bicycle has a bell. It could be said that
 the bell is a property of the bicycle object. This bell could also be rung. 
 However, the reason, the intention, and the result of somebody ringing 
 the bell on a bicycle is not the same as ringing the bell on a door.
