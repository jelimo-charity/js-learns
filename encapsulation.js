encapsulation has to do with making a code implementation "hidden" 
from other users, in the sense that they don't have to know how
 my code works in order to "consume" the code.

//example:

"abc".toUpperCase();

/*
I don't really need to worry or even waste time thinking about how 
the toUpperCase() method works. All I want is to use it, since I know 
it's available to me. Even if the underlying syntax - that is, the 
implementation of the toUpperCase() method changes - as long as it
 doesn't break my code, I don't have to worry about what it does in the
  background, or even how it does it.
