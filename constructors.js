/*
JavaScript has a number of built-in object types, such as:

 Math, Date, Object, Function, Boolean, Symbol, Array, Map, Set, Promise, JSON, etc.

These objects are sometimes referred to as "native objects".

Constructor functions, commonly referred to as just "constructors", are special 
functions that allow us to build instances of these built-in native objects.
 All the constructors are capitalized.

To use a constructor function, I must prepend it with the operator new.

For example, to create a new instance of the Date object, I can run: new Date().
 What I get back is the current datetime, such as:

Thu Feb 03 2022 11:24:08 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)
